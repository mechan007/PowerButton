This is my first project on GitHub

This project was created out of the need to turn on and off a 3D printer with a button on the front panel. 
The emphasis was on powering the module directly from the mains voltage, also on the possible implementation
in existing devices, a button on the front panel and preventing shutdown by accidentally pressing the button.

The project is functional, but not finished (perhaps a prototype?),
it is intended for people who are familiar with this area.

Hopefully I will be able to continue and improve it.

I am also open to your questions, comments and suggestions,
but I warn you in advance that I am not able to respond immediately.

!!!Warning!!! This project uses high (mains) voltage! And can severely damage health, or cause death,
especially to people who do not know what they are doing! This project is not a final product,
it is not a recommendation or a guide! Everything you do with this, you do at your own risk!

Thank you for reading this far...
